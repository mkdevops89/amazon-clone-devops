## 💼 Key Projects / Experience

### **Lead DevOps Engineer | E-Commerce Reference Architecture (Amazon Clone)**
*Designed and implemented a production-grade, multi-cloud microservices platform handling e-commerce workflows.*

**Infrastructure & Automation**
*   **Advanced IaC**: refactored monolithic Terraform into atomic modules managed by **Terragrunt**, enabling efficient multi-environment (Dev/Stage/Prod) deployments with DRY principles.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure**: Implemented **Packer** to bake hardened AMIs with pre-installed dependencies, reducing autoscaling launch times by 80%.
*   **Service Mesh**: Deployed **Istio** to manage microservices traffic, implementing mTLS encryption and Canary Deployments for zero-downtime releases.

**CI/CD & DevSecOps**
*   **Comprehensive Security**: Built a "Fort Knox" pipeline integrating **Snyk** (SCA) for dependency scanning and **OWASP ZAP** (DAST) for runtime attack simulation.
*   **Secret Management**: Deployed **HashiCorp Vault** to centrally manage secrets, implementing dynamic database credentials to eliminate long-lived passwords.
*   **GitOps**: Utilized **ArgoCD** to synchronize Kubernetes manifests from Git, ensuring no manual changes occur in production ("ClickOps").

**Observability & Reliability**
*   **Centralized Logging**: Deployed the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to aggregate logs from 50+ microservices, enabling rapid root-cause analysis.
*   **Monitoring**: Configured **Prometheus & Grafana** for real-time metrics and alerting on "Golden Signals" (Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation).
